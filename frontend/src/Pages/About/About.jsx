          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>ShopSmart was founded by a team of entrepreneurs who were frustrated with the traditional grocery shopping experience. We believed that there had to be a better way to shop for groceries, one that didn't involve long lines, crowded aisles, and endless searching for products.</p>
